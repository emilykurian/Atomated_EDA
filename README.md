# Atomated_EDA
# Aim
Aims to automate the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process using Python and Streamlit.  The automation involves creating a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload a CSV file, and subsequently generates various charts and statistics to provide insights into the dataset.
# Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial phase in the data analysis process that involves the initial exploration, visualization, and understanding of a dataset before diving into more complex analyses or modeling. EDA plays a pivotal role in revealing patterns, trends, and insights hidden within the data, helping analysts and data scientists make informed decisions.

During EDA, we examine  the distribution of variables, identify outliers, explore relationships between features, and gain a comprehensive overview of the dataset's characteristics. Traditionally, EDA has been a manual and time-intensive task, requiring analysts to create numerous plots, conduct statistical tests, and iteratively explore the data to gain insights.

However, with the advent of technology and the rise of automation tools, there has been a paradigm shift in how EDA is performed. Automating the EDA process offers several benefits, transforming it into a more efficient and scalable operation.
